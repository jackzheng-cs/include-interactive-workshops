# 🎨 Workshop #4 — Color Picker Code-Along

Welcome to the **Color Picker Code-Along!**

In this short hands-on workshop, you’ll build an interactive web page using **React (Next.js)** where clicking a color button changes the page’s background color.

This project will help you understand:
- ✅ How to use **React components** and **props**
- ✅ Managing state with **`useState`**
- ✅ Passing functions between parent and child components
- ✅ Styling with **SCSS** and adding hover effects

---

### 🚀 Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
---

### 🧠 Workshop Steps

Open /colorpicker/page.jsx — this is your code-along file.

Create a piece of state with useState to track the background color.

Add an array of color options (your palette).

Map through the palette and render <ColorButton /> for each color.

Pass props so clicking a button updates the background color.

Compare your work with /colorpicker/solution to see the final version.
